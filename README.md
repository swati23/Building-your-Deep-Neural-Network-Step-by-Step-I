# Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step-I
Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step
Deep learning specialization. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next Building-your-Deep-Neural-Network-Step-by-Step-II to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this you will:

- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.
